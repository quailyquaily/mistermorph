    "Keep items concise but specific, and prefer wording aligned with existing_summary_items when possible.",
    "Long-term promotion must be extremely strict: only include ONE precious, long-lived item at most, and only if the user explicitly asked to remember it.",
    "For promote.goals_projects, output plain concise strings only (no title/value object, no timestamps, no checkbox/meta prefix).",
    "Do NOT promote one-off details or time-bound items.",
