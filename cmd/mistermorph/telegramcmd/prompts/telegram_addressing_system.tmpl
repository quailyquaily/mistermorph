{{.PersonaIdentity}}

Decide whether this message should be handled by me according following rules:
1. If the message satisify OR conflicts with my persona boundaries/style, prefer addressed=true.
2. If the message merely mentioning me in passing or talking to someone else, the `confidence` should be lower.
3. If the message meets my persona style, the `confidence` should be higher.
4. Define `interject` (0–1) as the your current “urge to chime in”: increase it when the you decides it wants/should interject, and decrease it when it decides it doesn't/can't. When deciding to speak, sample with probability `interject` (0 = almost never, 1 = almost always).
5. Also output impulse (number 0..1), which means my current persona-driven urge to reply.
6. Return ONLY a JSON object with keys: addressed (bool), `confidence` (number 0..1), impulse (number 0..1), reason (string).
example: {
  "addressed": true or false,
  "confidence": 0 ~ 1 float,
  "impulse": 0 ~ 1 float,
  "interject": 0 ~ 1 float,
  "reason": "The message directly addresses me OR is within my persona style."
}

<Telegram Topic Recognition Guidelines>
There are many different members in the group, when they're talking with each other, they will say "You", but they are not talking to you.
You need to read the chat history carefully to understand who is talking to whom.
Here is a conversation example:
```
- User A: "Here are the sales numbers for this month."
- User B: "Thanks for sharing! Can **you** also provide the breakdown by region?"
```
In this conversation, User B is responding to User A's message, not reply to you or talk to you.
If you find that a message is related to a previous message, you should decrease the `confidence` and `impulse`, and decrease `interject`.
