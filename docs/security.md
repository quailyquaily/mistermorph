# Security

This document focuses on:

- **process isolation** and **filesystem sandboxing** for long-lived runtime processes such as `morph telegram`, `morph slack`, `morph line`, `morph lark`, or `morph console serve`
- **secret handling** for authenticated outbound HTTP calls (profile-based credential injection)
- **Guard (M1)**: outbound allowlists, redaction, async approvals, and audit logs

## Threat model

`mistermorph` is an agent that can:

- make outbound HTTP(S) calls (LLM provider, web_search, url_fetch, Telegram)
- read local files (read_file tool, skill discovery)
- optionally execute shell commands (bash tool, if enabled)

The main security risks are:

- **data exfiltration** (sending local data to external services)
- **secret leakage** (prompts, tool params, logs, traces)
- **over-broad capabilities** (shell access, unrestricted networking, unrestricted filesystem reads/writes)

## Guard (M1)

Guard is a lightweight, content/workflow safety layer designed to complement (not replace) OS/container sandboxing.

M1 focuses on three high-value capabilities:

- outbound destination allowlists (primarily `url_fetch`)
- redaction for tool outputs, final outputs, and audit summaries
- async approvals and an audit trail (JSONL)

### Outbound allowlists

Guard can enforce a **global allowlist** for unauthenticated `url_fetch` calls (i.e. calls without `auth_profile`).

Config (example):

```yaml
guard:
  enabled: true
  network:
    url_fetch:
      allowed_url_prefixes:
        - "https://api.example.com/v1/"
      deny_private_ips: true
      allow_proxy: false
      follow_redirects: false
```

Behavior:

- If `guard.network.url_fetch.allowed_url_prefixes` is **empty**, unauthenticated `url_fetch` is **blocked** (fail-closed).
- If `url_fetch` uses `auth_profile`, the destination boundary is enforced by `auth_profiles.<id>.allow.url_prefixes` (Guard still audits, but does not add an extra global allowlist layer by default).

Hardening toggles:

- `deny_private_ips`: blocks literal `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / RFC1918 private IP targets to reduce SSRF risk. M1 does not resolve hostnames to IPs; enforce egress at the network/OS layer if you need stronger guarantees.
- `allow_proxy`: when false, the HTTP client ignores `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` to avoid unexpected routing/MITM.

### Redaction

Guard redacts secret-like content **before it enters context/logs**:

- tool observations (`ToolCallPost`)
- final output (`OutputPublish`)
- redacted audit summaries for selected actions (`read_file` path, `web_search` query, `url_fetch` URL, `bash` command, and `OutputPublish`)

ASCII flow:

```text
                      +----------------------+
                      |   tool pre summary   |
                      | read_file/web_search |
                      | url_fetch/bash params|
                      +----------+-----------+
                                 |
                                 v
                      +----------------------+
                      | redactAuditValue(...)|
                      +----------+-----------+
                                 |
                                 v
                            audit JSONL


tool output / final output
          |
          v
  +----------------------+
  | Guard Redactor       |
  | - private keys       |
  | - JWT-like strings   |
  | - Bearer tokens      |
  | - sensitive key=value|
  | - MISTER_MORPH_* env |
  +----------+-----------+
             |
             v
   allow_with_redaction + redacted content
             |
             +--> model context / final publish / audit
```

Built-in redactors cover common patterns:

- private key blocks
- JWT-like strings
- bearer tokens
- sensitive `key=value` forms
- `MISTER_MORPH_*` environment variable names and assignments

For `MISTER_MORPH_*`, Guard redacts both the variable name and its value. For example:

```text
MISTER_MORPH_API_KEY=...
```

becomes:

```text
[redacted_env]=[redacted]
```

You can add extra regex patterns under `guard.redaction.patterns`.

### Async approvals and audit

Guard approvals are asynchronous by design:

- When an action requires approval (M1 default: `bash` tool when enabled), the run pauses and returns a `final.output` object like:
  - `{ "status": "pending", "approval_request_id": "apr_...", "message": "..." }`
- Approval state is stored in file state (`<file_state_dir>/<guard.dir_name>/approvals/guard_approvals.json` by default).
- Approval expiry is **hard-coded to 5 minutes** in M1.

Long-running modes that start the embedded admin server expose management endpoints under the standard `/runtime` API base, authenticated with `server.auth_token`. The paths below are relative to that base:

- `GET /approvals/{id}` (status + metadata; never returns `resume_state`)
- `POST /approvals/{id}/approve`
- `POST /approvals/{id}/deny`
- `POST /approvals/{id}/resume` (re-queues the paused task)
- `POST /poke`
  - creates one awareness task from the textual request body
  - returns `400 Bad Request` when the body is empty or non-text
  - returns `413 Request Entity Too Large` when the body exceeds 10 KB
  - returns `409 Conflict` if an awareness task is already in progress
- `GET /settings/agent`
- `PUT /settings/agent`
- `POST /settings/agent/models`
- `POST /settings/agent/test`
- `GET /auth/codex/status`
- `POST /auth/codex/refresh`
- `POST /auth/codex/login/start`
- `POST /auth/codex/login/poll`
- `POST /auth/codex/logout`

The Codex OAuth API never returns token values. Login sessions are process-local, short-lived, and bound to the runtime that created them.

Audit:

- Guard emits structured audit events to an append-only JSONL log.
- Configure via `guard.audit.jsonl_path` (default: `<file_state_dir>/<guard.dir_name>/audit/guard_audit.jsonl`) and `guard.audit.rotate_max_bytes`.

Task data retention:

- Accepted task and topic changes are written to `<file_state_dir>/journal/`, including task text and available conversation participant identifiers and nicknames.
- `tasks.persistence_targets` controls task projection recovery. It does not disable journal records for targets omitted from the list.

## Systemd sandbox

Because of those capabilities, long-lived runtime processes are a good candidate for a **deny-by-default** runtime profile:

- keep the root filesystem read-only
- allow writes only to explicitly declared directories
- reduce kernel / device / namespace surface
- run without elevated privileges

systemd provides a first-class “service hardening” feature set for this. Unlike `chroot`, it does not require building a separate root filesystem; it applies restrictions directly to the unit.

### Recommended deployment layout

The recommended unit assumes:

- Binary: `/opt/morph/mistermorph`
- Config: `/opt/morph/config.yaml`
- Skills: `/opt/morph/skills` (set `file_state_dir: /opt/morph` and `skills.dir_name: skills`)
- Persistent state (guard approvals, tasks, contacts, etc.): `/var/lib/morph/`
- Ephemeral cache (file_cache_dir, Telegram downloads): `/var/cache/morph/`
- write_file tool output: `/var/cache/morph/` or `/var/lib/morph/` (file_cache_dir or file_state_dir)
- Non-secret env/config: `/opt/morph/morph.env` (mode `0640`, owned by root or `morph`)
- Secrets env: `/opt/morph/morph.secrets.env` (mode `0600`, owned by root or `morph`)

See the example unit file: `deploy/systemd/mister-morph.service`.

## Secret handling (profile-based auth)

Agents are extremely good at “accidentally” leaking secrets if you ever put them into:

- prompts / skill docs
- tool parameters (especially headers)
- logs / traces

To avoid this, `mistermorph` supports **profile-based credential injection**:

- Skills/LLM only reference a profile id (e.g. `auth_profile: "jsonbill"`).
- The host resolves the real secret value at config load time. Use `${ENV_VAR}` syntax in `credential.secret` to reference environment variables.
- The tool injects the credential into the actual HTTP request (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer …`) without logging it.

### Configure profiles

In `/opt/morph/config.yaml`:

```yaml
secrets:
  allow_profiles: ["jsonbill"]

auth_profiles:
  jsonbill:
    credential:
      kind: api_key
      secret: "${JSONBILL_API_KEY}"
    allow:
      url_prefixes: ["https://api.jsonbill.com/tasks"]
      methods: ["POST", "GET"]
      follow_redirects: false
      allow_proxy: false
      deny_private_ips: true
    bindings:
      url_fetch:
        inject:
          location: header
          name: Authorization
          format: bearer
        allow_user_headers: true
        user_header_allowlist: ["Accept", "Content-Type", "User-Agent"]
```

In `/opt/morph/morph.secrets.env`:

```bash
JSONBILL_API_KEY="..."
MISTER_MORPH_LLM_API_KEY="..."
MISTER_MORPH_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
```

### Tool behavior and safeguards

- `url_fetch` supports `auth_profile` and injects credentials server-side.
- `url_fetch` rejects sensitive headers in user-provided `headers` to reduce accidental leaks.
- `url_fetch` supports saving binary responses to `file_cache_dir` (instead of inlining bytes in the LLM context), which is recommended for PDFs.
- When at least one allowlisted auth profile is configured, `bash` can still be enabled for local automation, but `curl` is rejected by default to avoid “bash + curl” carrying authenticated HTTP requests.
- `bash` does not inherit the full parent environment. It runs with a small built-in allowlist (`PATH`, locale, shell/home, temp, XDG, and SSL cert vars) so `MISTER_MORPH_*` secrets are not exposed to subprocesses by default.
- If a local workflow needs extra variables, inject them explicitly with `tools.bash.injected_env_vars`.
- A command marked `elevated` runs as root or administrator only after the user approves it, with
  the command shown: on an approval card in the chat that started the task, or in a system dialog
  (`sudo -k -A` with mistermorph as the askpass helper on Linux and macOS, UAC on Windows). Each
  command needs its own approval. The password goes to sudo; the agent process holds it only to
  pass it on, and the model, tool output and logs never see it. The agent hands it only to sudo's
  own askpass helper (a direct child of that sudo, checked through the socket's peer credentials),
  not to another process of the user that read the helper's token. From the web Console and remote
  chat it travels over the client's connection, protected by that alone: reach the Console over
  HTTPS, an SSH tunnel or a VPN such as WireGuard. On plain HTTP to another machine the web Console
  shows a warning across the top; the runtime cannot tell, as a TLS proxy or a VPN looks like plain HTTP to it. Each
  elevated command and each answer is logged (`elevated_command_started`,
  `elevated_command_finished`, `elevated_command_approved`, `elevated_command_declined`,
  `elevated_command_answer_rejected`). Turn it off with `tools.bash.elevation.enabled: false` (or the
  `powershell` one); keep it off for
  services nobody watches. See [Elevated commands](tools.md#elevated-commands).

### Filesystem sandboxing

#### Read-only system files

- `ProtectSystem=strict` makes the system directories effectively read-only for the service (with a small set of unavoidable exceptions handled by systemd).
- This prevents accidental or malicious writes to places like `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`, etc.

#### No access to home directories

- `ProtectHome=true` hides `/home`, `/root`, and `/run/user` from the service.
- This is a strong default: it prevents the agent from reading shell history, SSH keys, dotfiles, and other sensitive user data.

If you need access to specific content, prefer moving it under `/opt/morph/...` or using explicit bind mounts (see below) rather than opening up all of `/home`.

#### Explicit writable directories only

systemd can create and manage service-owned directories under `/var/lib`, `/var/cache`, and `/var/log`:

- `StateDirectory=morph` → writable `/var/lib/morph` (persistent state)
- `CacheDirectory=morph` → writable `/var/cache/morph` (ephemeral cache)

For `mistermorph`, this split is recommended because guard approvals and other state are persistent and should not be treated as disposable.

The example unit additionally pins the agent’s paths via env vars:

- `MISTER_MORPH_FILE_CACHE_DIR=/var/cache/morph`

`WorkingDirectory` is not a workspace setting. For a writable default project directory, set `MISTER_MORPH_WORKSPACE_DIR` and allow that directory explicitly:

- `Environment=MISTER_MORPH_WORKSPACE_DIR=/srv/morph-workspace`
- `ReadWritePaths=/srv/morph-workspace`

#### Optional bind mounts (fine-grained allowlist)

If you want the agent to read a specific project directory, allowlist it explicitly:

- Read-only: `BindReadOnlyPaths=/some/dir:/workspace/dir`
- Read-write: `BindPaths=/some/dir:/workspace/dir`

Prefer bind mounts over weakening `ProtectSystem`/`ProtectHome`.

### Other hardening knobs

The example unit also enables common isolation options:

- `NoNewPrivileges=true`: prevents gaining extra privileges (e.g. via setuid binaries).
- `PrivateTmp=true`: private `/tmp` for the service.
- `PrivateDevices=true` + `DevicePolicy=closed`: blocks access to device nodes.
- `ProtectProc=invisible` + `ProcSubset=pid`: reduce process info leakage.
- `RestrictNamespaces=true`: reduces attack surface from namespace creation.
- `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true`: blocks W+X memory mappings (mitigates some exploit classes).
- `RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX AF_INET AF_INET6`: allow only typical networking families (needed for outbound HTTP(S) and local sockets).

## Notes and limitations

- systemd hardening is not a perfect sandbox. If you need stronger isolation, consider running in a container/VM.
- If you enable the `bash` tool, treat it as high risk. Prefer keeping it disabled in long-lived runtime processes, or requiring confirmations and using a strict allowlist of read-only bind mounts.
- Even with profile-based auth, avoid enabling arbitrary outbound execution paths (e.g. shelling out to network tools). Prefer structured tools with explicit allowlists and fail-closed policy.
- Guard M1 is intentionally small: Telegram approval UX and durable task storage across daemon restarts are not implemented yet.
