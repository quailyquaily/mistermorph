# Mistermorph Console SPA

This document describes the Console SPA under `web/console`, used by:

```bash
morph console
```

`morph console serve` remains supported with the same flags and behavior.

Stack:
- Vue 3 + Vue Router
- `quail-ui`
- Vite (`src` -> `dist`)
- package manager: `pnpm`

Quail UI JavaScript uses named imports from `src/components/quail.js`, not the
full `QuailUI` plugin. Add new components there, including any dependencies that
the component resolves through Vue's global registry. `main.js` keeps the shared
popup-close handler and the full Quail UI stylesheet.

## Runtime Notes

- Console APIs are served under `<console.base_path>/api` (default: `/api`).
- Runtime views (`Chat`, `Runtime`, `Tasks`, `Stats`, `Audit`, `Files`, `Contacts`) read from the endpoint selected in the top bar.
- `console` always exposes one built-in local runtime endpoint (`Console Local`).
  - It runs tasks in its own runtime loop via shared runtime core.
  - Its runtime API uses the shared `daemonruntime` handler. With an explicit `server.auth_token`, the same handler is available at `<console.base_path>/runtime` on the Web listener.
  - If `server.auth_token` is unset, the local runtime generates an internal in-process token and does not expose `<console.base_path>/runtime`.
  - An explicitly started Console publishes a private loopback control endpoint with generated credentials for local service control. Ordinary terminal chat executes in its own process.
  - Task/topic changes are written to stable segments under `<file_state_dir>/journal/`. When `tasks.persistence_targets` contains `console`, its task projection is also saved and restored across process restarts.
  - The local runtime currently provides topic-aware APIs (`GET /topics`, `DELETE /topics/{topic_id}`) and runs awareness through the shared direct awareness runtime. Periodic heartbeat is optional; `/poke` remains available when heartbeat is disabled.
- Additional remote runtime endpoints can be configured under `console.endpoints` in `config.yaml`. Each `url` is the complete runtime API base URL; new built-in runtime servers use `/runtime`.
- Remote runtime endpoints still use the shared runtime API contract, but topic APIs are only available when that runtime injects `TopicReader` / `TopicDeleter`.
- A remote endpoint whose health payload reports `mode: console` exposes the same target-owned settings as the built-in local Console. The SPA sends those requests through `/api/proxy` to the remote Console's `/runtime` API.
- Task WebSocket frames from a remote Console are relayed by the current Console. The browser never receives the remote runtime token, and task polling remains active as the fallback.

## Features

- Overview:
  - endpoint list only
  - endpoint card click selects endpoint and opens `Chat`
  - auto-refresh every 60 seconds
- Setup:
  - dedicated `/setup` route for the minimal Console Local configuration path
  - shown when Console Local is online but local chat is not yet submittable
  - guides the user to finish provider/model/API key config, then refresh status
- Chat:
  - send task directly to current agent
  - left secondary sidebar for topics, with one `New Topic` button, topic switching, current-topic delete, and a hidden system topic toggle exposed by clicking the topic sidebar title five times
  - topic title is seeded from the first prompt; once the new topic's task reaches the queue, a separate background LLM request names it and selects a theme icon from a fixed Phosphor catalog, without waiting for the task's reply
  - initial naming uses only the first user message, keeps its language, and does not invent a subject for greetings; request timeouts, retries, and fallback follow the configured LLM route
  - generated titles and icons are persisted together; failed naming leaves the seed title, later messages do not rename the topic, and background results cannot overwrite a customized title or restore a deleted topic
  - topic items use the selected icon, or a chat icon for old/unknown values; visible pages check metadata every five seconds without resetting topic selection, drafts, or pagination
  - `internal/taskdomain/topic_icons.json` maps theme IDs to descriptions; matching regular-weight Phosphor SVGs live in `web/console/src/assets/topic-icons/`, with their MIT license. Topic icons use CSS masks and inherit the text color without Vue icon components. Greetings use a separate waving-hand icon, with specific themes for pets, babies, home and family, food, fitness, music, and travel
  - `Regenerate name` sits below the properties in the Topic panel, separate from Delete Topic, on desktop and mobile. It generates the name and icon from the first user message and the latest six conversation turns, preferring recent substantive discussion when the subject changes
  - regeneration excludes slash commands, reasoning, tool logs, and incomplete replies. Each user message is capped at 600 characters and each completed assistant reply at 400; the total naming input is capped at 8,000 characters
  - regeneration keeps the current name and icon until success, rejects duplicate requests for the same topic, and leaves them unchanged on failure. A title revision prevents late results from overwriting subsequent edits or deletion; starting regeneration also invalidates pending initial naming. Empty and system topics cannot be regenerated
  - topic-scoped `ChatHistoryItems` style list
  - receive task progress over WebSocket for local and remote Console endpoints, with `/tasks/{id}` polling as fallback
- Tasks:
  - list + detail (read-only)
- Files:
  - unified editor for `cron.yaml`, `identity.yaml`, `soul.md`, and `HEARTBEAT.md`
- Contacts:
  - dedicated sidebar entry
  - structured list rendering from `ACTIVE.md` + `INACTIVE.md`
  - status filter (`all|active|inactive`)
  - circular cached avatars with a stable initial fallback; local and remote endpoints use the same authenticated proxy path
- Audit:
  - browse Guard audit files
  - cursor-based reads for large JSONL logs (`limit` + opaque `cursor`)
  - newest entries shown first in the UI
  - entries grouped by `run_id` for easier review
  - `OutputPublish` audit events mark `body_omitted_from_audit: true` in the raw JSONL when the final body is intentionally not persisted
  - Guard keeps `guard_audit.jsonl` as the canonical ledger and may emit per-decision mirrors such as `guard_audit.allow_with_redaction.jsonl`, `guard_audit.require_approval.jsonl`, and `guard_audit.deny.jsonl`
- Settings:
  - language selector
  - logout button (danger style)
  - entry moved to top-right, next to endpoint switcher
  - Agent, Tools, Skills, Persona, Channels, Managed Runtimes, Guard, update checks, and provider account actions target the selected Console endpoint
  - language and logout remain browser-host actions and do not target a remote endpoint
  - agent tool toggles mirror `config.yaml` structure under `tools.<name>.enabled`
  - the Settings page now exposes the `spawn` toggle together with the other agent tools
- i18n:
  - English, Chinese, Japanese
  - language selector appears on Login and Settings (not in top nav)

## API Surface (under `/api`)

Auth:
- `POST /auth/login`
- `POST /auth/logout`
- `GET /auth/me`

Console settings:
- `GET /settings/agent`
- `PUT /settings/agent`
- `POST /settings/agent/models`
- `POST /settings/agent/test`
- `GET /settings/console`
- `PUT /settings/console`
- `GET /settings/auto-update`
- `PUT /settings/auto-update`
- `POST /settings/auto-update/check`
- `/auth/codex/*`
- `/auth/xai/*`
- `/auth/pro/*`

Settings payload note:
- The `tools` object mirrors the config tree, for example `tools.spawn.enabled` and `tools.bash.enabled`.

Dashboard/system:
- `GET /endpoints`
- `GET /proxy?endpoint=<ref>&uri=<runtime-path>`

Tasks:
- `GET /proxy?endpoint=<ref>&uri=/tasks?limit=<n>[&cursor=<opaque>]`
- `POST /proxy?endpoint=<ref>&uri=/tasks`
- `GET /proxy?endpoint=<ref>&uri=/tasks/{id}`
- `GET /proxy?endpoint=<ref>&uri=/topics?limit=<n>[&cursor=<opaque>]`
- `DELETE /proxy?endpoint=<ref>&uri=/topics/{topic_id}`
- `POST /proxy?endpoint=<ref>&uri=/topics/{topic_id}/regenerate-title`

Notes:
- Topic APIs are guaranteed on `Console Local`; other runtimes may return `503` if they do not expose topic readers/deleters.
- Regeneration returns the updated topic, including its title, icon, and `title_revision`. It returns `400` for an empty or system topic, `404` for a missing topic, `409` for an in-flight request or concurrent title change, and `503` for generation failure or an unsupported runtime. It uses the configured LLM request timeout, retries, and fallback, not the ordinary 20-second proxy timeout; disconnecting cancels the request.

Runtime routes used through `/proxy`:
- Selected Console settings:
  - `GET|PUT /settings/agent`
  - `POST /settings/agent/models`
  - `POST /settings/agent/test`
  - `GET|PUT /settings/console`
  - `GET|PUT /settings/auto-update`
  - `POST /settings/auto-update/check`
  - `/auth/codex/*`, `/auth/xai/*`, `/auth/pro/*`
- Overview/runtime:
  - `GET /overview`
- Files:
  - `GET /state/files`
  - `GET /state/files/{name}` (`cron.yaml|identity.yaml|soul.md|HEARTBEAT.md`)
  - `PUT /state/files/{name}`
  - `GET /persona/files`
  - `GET /persona/files/{name}` (`identity.yaml|soul.md`)
  - `PUT /persona/files/{name}`
  - `GET /persona/avatar`
  - `PUT /persona/avatar`
  - `DELETE /persona/avatar`
- Contacts:
  - `GET /contacts/list?status=all|active|inactive`
  - `GET /contacts/avatar?contact_id=<contact_id>`

`/contacts/list` may return an endpoint-relative `avatar_url` for a Contact whose cached avatar exists. The URL is derived state and is not written to Contact YAML. Console fetches the image through the selected endpoint, so a remote Contact avatar is never read from the local runtime by mistake.
- Audit:
  - `GET /audit/files`
  - `GET /audit/logs?file=<name>&limit=<n>[&cursor=<opaque>]`

Paginated runtime lists return `items`, `limit`, `has_next`, and optional `next_cursor`.

## Security and Caching Notes

- Console password is required (`console.password` or `console.password_hash`).
- Protected APIs require Bearer token auth.
- Anti-bruteforce protection is enabled in the backend.
- JSON API responses use no-store cache headers.
- SPA fetch requests use `cache: "no-store"`.

## Setup Wizard

- When no readable `config.yaml` is found, `morph install` starts an interactive setup wizard.
- The wizard now includes Console setup inputs:
  - `console.listen`
  - `console.base_path`
  - `console.password`
  - first `console.endpoints[]` entry (`name`, `url`, `auth_token` env var name)
- After input, wizard prints:
  - generated Console config snippet
  - suggested env var names
  - endpoint health probe result (`GET <endpoint>/health`)
- If the endpoint URL is local loopback (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1`), wizard auto-generates a runtime auth token and uses `MISTER_MORPH_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` for endpoint auth.

## Build (production static)

1. Build frontend:

```bash
cd web/console
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

2. Stage embedded console assets for the CLI/backend binary:

```bash
cd ../..
./scripts/stage-console-assets.sh
```

3. Start console backend + static hosting:

```bash
MISTER_MORPH_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN=dev-token \
MISTER_MORPH_ENDPOINT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=dev-token \
MISTER_MORPH_CONSOLE_PASSWORD=secret \
go run ./cmd/mistermorph console
```

Example `config.yaml` snippet (`console.endpoints` is optional now):

```yaml
server:
  auth_token: "${MISTER_MORPH_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN}"

console:
  endpoints:
    - name: "Telegram"
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8787/runtime"
      auth_token: "${MISTER_MORPH_ENDPOINT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN}"
```

4. Open:

`http://127.0.0.1:9080/`

## Dev (hot reload)

1. Build and stage console assets once before running the CLI from source:

```bash
cd web/console
pnpm install
pnpm build
cd ../..
./scripts/stage-console-assets.sh
```

2. Start console backend:

```bash
MISTER_MORPH_CONSOLE_PASSWORD=secret \
MISTER_MORPH_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN=dev-token \
go run ./cmd/mistermorph console
```

3. Start Vite dev server:

```bash
cd web/console
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

4. Open:

`http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

Notes:
- Vite proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:9080`.
- During frontend dev, Vite page is enough; backend static `dist` is mainly for production serving.
- If you omit `--console-static-dir`, `console` falls back to its embedded SPA assets.
- `./scripts/stage-console-assets.sh` is required before `go run ./cmd/mistermorph ...`, because the CLI validates embedded Console assets at startup.
- Optional external endpoints should point to an existing channel runtime such as `morph telegram`, `morph slack`, `morph line`, or `morph lark`.


## Shared topics in the terminal

`mistermorph chat` (or `morph`) executes locally. It does not start Console,
bind `console.listen`, or require a runtime token. Start `morph console`
separately to use the Web UI.

Chat and Web share topic IDs, tasks, replies, workspace attachments, and context
checkpoints when they use the same `file_state_dir` and `tasks.dir_name`, with
`console` enabled in `tasks.persistence_targets`. Disabling persistence also
disables cross-process history sharing. Chat does not change this setting.

The first message creates a topic. `/topics` opens the same topic picker used
for explicit remote connections, filtered by the current workspace. Use
`/topic switch <id>` or `chat --topic <id>` to open an existing topic, including
one outside the picker scope. Selecting a topic restores its history with the
normal chat presentation. `/topic history` reads the latest saved history;
`/topic history more` loads older entries. Each new local turn reads shared
history again, including messages added by Web.

The task store refreshes its projection from the journal under a process-shared
file lock before reads and writes. Chat does not run Console's restart recovery.
A live chat session holds a separate ownership lock so starting Console cannot
cancel its tasks. When that session exits unexpectedly, subsequent store access
marks its unfinished tasks canceled. Different topics can execute independently.
While a topic is active in chat, another executor cannot start a turn or delete
that topic. Stop and approve local tasks in their owning terminal.

Ordinary chat accepts local execution flags such as `--model` and `--workspace`.
`--standalone` is a hidden compatibility alias, with the same topics and UI.
Local `/exit` and `/quit` cancel the current task and save the outcome. They do
not stop a separately running Console. Local topic switching and context-changing
commands wait until the current task or approval finishes.

`<file_state_dir>/stats/topics_projection.json` remains a derived list cache.
Local chat reads the shared task store, so this cache is not its history source.

The remaining connection details apply when `--runtime-url` is explicitly set.

To connect to an explicit address with `--runtime-url`, enable that Console's
public runtime API with `server.auth_token`, then set
`MISTERMORPH_RUNTIME_TOKEN` to that Console's `server.auth_token` using your
shell/secret manager. Explicit URLs never inherit automatic local credentials or
the local configuration token. Do not put the token in a URL or CLI flag.

```bash
mistermorph chat
mistermorph chat --topic <topic-id>
mistermorph chat --runtime-url http://127.0.0.1:9080/runtime
mistermorph chat --runtime-url https://morph.example.com/morph/runtime --topic <topic-id>
```

Use the full runtime API base URL, including any reverse-proxy prefix. Non-loopback
connections require HTTPS. This connects directly to `/runtime`, not the browser
session/proxy API. Connection failure never starts a local agent. Explicit local
provider/model/skills/execution overrides and `--workspace`/`--no-workspace` cannot
be combined with `--runtime-url`. In remote chat, use `/workspace` to set the
server workspace.

In connected mode, `/topics` opens the picker and queries the runtime API.
The picker shows topics in the **server-resolved current workspace**, never the
client's working directory. Arrow keys move selection;
Enter opens the selected topic or activates the New topic / Load more row; Esc returns to the previous conversation and its draft. Type to
filter loaded titles/IDs, Ctrl+L loads more, Ctrl+R refreshes the fixed workspace,
Ctrl+S prints the full endpoint/workspace/status, and Ctrl+N starts a local draft in that workspace. The first message creates the
server topic. There is no empty-topic creation API. Topics outside the picker scope
remain accessible via `/topic switch <id>`.

| Command | Explicit remote connection behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `/topic new` | Resume the single new-topic draft, or start one without creating server state |
| `/topic switch <id>` | Validate and load an existing topic; failure preserves the current view |
| `/topic history [more]` | Redisplay loaded history / load the next older page |
| `/workspace` | Read server workspace (draft: show pending path/default intent) |
| `/workspace attach <path>` | Bind an existing topic on the server, or stage a path for the draft's first send |
| `/workspace detach` | Remove attachment; resolve server default, **not** disable workspace |
| `/status` | Full endpoint/topic/workspace and server context metadata |
| `/stop` | Explicitly stop tasks for the selected topic only |
| `/models`, `/skills`, `/think`, `/ctx` | Execute the Console runtime command in the current topic; `/ctx` requires an existing topic |
| `/reset` | Clear model context and its checkpoint, retaining shared chat history |
| `/init`, `/update` | Create/read or regenerate AGENTS.md in the server workspace |
| `/approve`, `/deny` | Resolve the pending approval through Console; y/n also works in the panel |
| `/agents`, `/agent`, `/subagents` | Inspect retained child execution records; Ctrl+G opens the same view |
| `/topic title regenerate` | Server-generated title, not manual rename |
| `/topic delete` | Confirm with y; server deletion also stops tasks and cleans up context |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | Disconnect without stopping server tasks |

Paths are interpreted on the **server**. Drafts are kept per topic only until the
client exits. Switching away or losing the connection does not stop tasks.
Esc or Ctrl+C while running stops tasks in the current topic, as does `/stop`.
Unknown submission outcomes are never automatically retried: inspect `/topics` and
history before sending again, especially after first-topic creation. A draft with
an unresolved creation remains blocked to prevent duplicate topics. Pending tasks
show the common approval panel; decisions in either terminal or Web apply to the
same server task. Approving resumes it, and denying rejects the pending action.

HTTP polling (normally every 3 seconds, backing off to 30 seconds on errors)
remains authoritative. WebSocket snapshots add multiline text/reasoning previews,
plan steps, recent activity and current activity for up to four active tasks in the
selected topic; other tasks remain
HTTP-tracked. Stream failures retry with backoff without interrupting polling.
Switching views or exiting closes subscriptions without stopping server tasks.
HTTP terminal results replace previews, so final answers are not printed twice.
Progress is bounded and clipped to terminal dimensions, keeping the composer
visible. Text/reasoning remain snapshot previews. Execution records are appended
to the transcript and retained with completed or pending tasks: tool parameters
and output, plan steps, file diffs, retries, and child-agent events. Reconnecting
uses record sequence numbers to avoid printing the same events twice. Retention
is bounded; see [terminal chat](chat.md#inspect-subagents) for limits. Older tasks
without execution traces restore their saved plans and tool activities alongside
their replies. Details that were never stored cannot be recovered.
Polling discovers other clients' new tasks,
title/workspace changes and deletion, including after the last task finishes.
Loaded history uses the normal chat presentation: `❯` for user messages and
Markdown for replies. Task IDs and successful completion statuses stay out of
message text; errors and approval requests appear separately. `/topic history`
gives the canonical loaded projection, including steering instructions. The `/` command
menu and `$` skill menu use the common chat UI; skills are read from Console.
Input recall history is saved locally, including multiline input. `/status` uses
the normal labelled display, and the startup header shows the provider and model.
The Console process must also be updated for the restored commands and records.
Remote chat does not read local topic files or import terminal input history.
Server persistence settings still apply. See the [design](feat/feat_20260917_tui_shared_topics.md)
for storage and execution boundaries.
