# Slack Setup (Socket Mode)

This document explains how to prepare credentials for `morph slack`, especially when you only have `client_id/client_secret`.

## 1. Credential Types

- `client_id` / `client_secret`
  - Used for OAuth token exchange (`code -> token`).
  - Cannot be used directly to run `morph slack`.
- Bot Token (`xoxb-...`)
  - Used for Web API calls (for example, `chat.postMessage`).
  - Required by `morph slack`: `slack.bot_token`.
- App Token (`xapp-...`)
  - Used by Socket Mode to open the WebSocket connection (`apps.connections.open`).
  - Required by `morph slack`: `slack.app_token`.

## 2. Enable Socket Mode First

In the Slack App dashboard:

1. Go to `Socket Mode`.
2. Turn on `Enable Socket Mode`.

## 3. Get the Bot Token (`xoxb-...`)

### Option A: Install from Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to `OAuth & Permissions`.
2. Add the minimum required bot scopes (see next section).
3. Click `Install to Workspace` (or `Reinstall` if scopes changed).
4. Copy `Bot User OAuth Token` (`xoxb-...`).

### Option B: If You Only Have `client_id/client_secret` (OAuth Exchange)

Complete OAuth authorization to get a `code`, then call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://slack.com/api/oauth.v2.access \
  -d client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d code=AUTH_CODE \
  -d redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
```

The `access_token` in the JSON response (usually `xoxb-...`) is your bot token.

## 4. Get the App Token (`xapp-...`)

`xapp` cannot be obtained via OAuth exchange with `client_id/client_secret`. You must generate it in the dashboard:

1. Go to `Basic Information`.
2. Find `App-Level Tokens`.
3. Click `Generate Token and Scopes`.
4. Add scope: `connections:write`.
5. Generate and copy the `xapp-...` token.

## 5. Required Permissions (Current Runtime)

Configure permissions in two places:

- `OAuth & Permissions` -> `Bot Token Scopes` (for `xoxb-...`)
- `Basic Information` -> `App-Level Tokens` (for `xapp-...`)

Required `Bot Token Scopes`:

- `app_mentions:read`
- `channels:history`
- `groups:history`
- `im:history`
- `mpim:history`
- `channels:read` (required to load public channel information)
- `groups:read` (required to load private channel information)
- `im:read` (required to load direct message information)
- `mpim:read` (required to load group direct message information)
- `chat:write`
- `files:read` (required for image attachments)
- `files:write` (required by `slack_send_file`)
- `emoji:read` (required to load workspace emoji names for `message_react`)
- `reactions:write` (required by `message_react`)
- `users:read`

If file sending or emoji reactions are intentionally disabled, the corresponding
`files:write` or `emoji:read` + `reactions:write` scopes can be omitted. The
`morph doctor` check treats the current built-in Slack feature set as the
baseline and reports those scopes as missing.

Required `App-Level Token` scope:

- `connections:write` (on `xapp-...`)

Event subscriptions for Socket Mode:

- `app_mention`
- `message.channels`
- `message.groups`
- `message.im`
- `message.mpim`

Image attachments arrive through normal message events. The runtime reads Slack file objects from those events and downloads `url_private_download` or `url_private` with the bot token. For Slack Connect placeholder files, it calls `files.info` first to load the real file metadata. Slack requires the token used for these file APIs and URLs to have `files:read`.

The runtime calls `conversations.info` to cache conversation names and types for contacts and cron notification targets. Slack selects the required read scope from the conversation type:

- Public channel: `channels:read`
- Private channel: `groups:read`
- Direct message: `im:read`
- Group direct message: `mpim:read`

The existing `users.info` lookup also supplies the sender's Contact avatar. Morph downloads the selected `profile.image_*` URL asynchronously and caches the image for seven days. The avatar is derived state and does not add fields to Contact YAML.

After adding or changing any scope:

1. Click `Reinstall to Workspace`.
2. Use the newest token values (`xoxb` / `xapp`).
3. Restart `morph slack`.

Run this after installing or reinstalling the Slack app:

```bash
morph doctor --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

When Slack credentials are configured, or `slack` is listed in
`console.managed_runtimes`, doctor calls `auth.test` to validate the bot token,
reads its granted scopes from Slack's `X-OAuth-Scopes` response header, and calls
`apps.connections.open` to validate the app token and its `connections:write`
scope. It reports status and missing scope names without printing either token.

If you see `missing_scope`, the usual cause is one of:

- Scope was added but app was not reinstalled.
- Runtime is still using an old token.

## 6. Configure Credentials

Environment variables (recommended):

```bash
export MISTER_MORPH_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN='xoxb-...'
export MISTER_MORPH_SLACK_APP_TOKEN='xapp-...'
```

Or in config file:

```yaml
slack:
  bot_token: "xoxb-..."
  app_token: "xapp-..."
  allowed_team_ids: []
  allowed_channel_ids: []
  group_trigger_mode: "smart" # strict|smart|talkative
  addressing_confidence_threshold: 0.6
  addressing_interject_threshold: 0.6
  task_timeout: "0s"
  max_concurrency: 3
```

Inbound Slack images are downloaded under `file_cache_dir/slack/` and passed to image-capable models as image parts. The current runtime accepts PNG, JPEG, and WebP images, keeps at most 3 images per message, and rejects images larger than 5 MiB each.

The Todo chat selector includes conversations recorded in active contacts as well as cached chat profiles. After Morph accepts a message from a new conversation, reload Todo to see that target without restarting the runtime. The selector reads local data and does not call Slack. Targets without a cached name display their full chat ID.

When fetching a Slack DM profile, Morph uses the other participant's display name, real name, or username. If no name is available, it uses the chat ID. Reading DM profiles requires `im:read`; resolving participant names requires `users:read`. For standalone `morph slack`, profile requests use the same effective bot token and API base URL as the Slack runtime, including a token supplied through `--slack-bot-token`.

## 7. Run Example

```bash
go run ./cmd/mistermorph slack \
  --slack-bot-token "$MISTER_MORPH_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" \
  --slack-app-token "$MISTER_MORPH_SLACK_APP_TOKEN"
```

## 8. Common Errors

- `missing slack.bot_token` / `missing slack.app_token`
  - Token was not provided, or env var names are incorrect.
- `slack auth.test failed: invalid_auth`
  - `xoxb` is invalid/expired/mis-copied, or installed in the wrong workspace.
- `slack users.info failed: missing_scope`
  - Bot token is missing `users:read`, or scope changed without reinstall/token refresh.
- `slack conversations.info failed: missing_scope`
  - Bot token is missing the read scope for that conversation type: `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `im:read`, or `mpim:read`.
- `slack image download http 403` or image-only messages cannot be read
  - Bot token is missing `files:read`, the app was not reinstalled after adding it, or the bot is not in the conversation where the file was shared.
- `slack files.getUploadURLExternal failed: missing_scope` or `slack files.completeUploadExternal failed: missing_scope`
  - Bot token is missing `files:write`, or the app was not reinstalled after adding it.
- `slack_emoji_catalog_load_failed ... slack emoji.list failed: missing_scope`
  - Bot token is missing `emoji:read`; `message_react` will not be registered until emoji catalog can be loaded.
- `slack reactions.add failed: missing_scope`
  - Bot token is missing `reactions:write`, or the app was not reinstalled after adding it.
- `slack apps.connections.open failed: not_allowed_token_type`
  - A non-`xapp` token was used, or `xapp` is missing `connections:write`.
- Not receiving channel messages
  - Check whether the bot is in the target channel, scopes are complete, and team/channel allowlists are not blocking.

## 9. Security Notes

- Do not commit `xoxb`/`xapp` to the repository.
- In production, prefer environment variables or a secret manager.
- Avoid logging full tokens.

## 10. Thread Behavior (Bus Semantics)

In the current implementation, Slack thread data is passed through fields in bus messages, not used as an independent routing key.

- On inbound, Slack `thread_ts` is written into:
  - `MessageEnvelope.reply_to`
  - `extensions.reply_to`
  - `extensions.thread_ts`
- On outbound delivery to Slack, thread selection priority is:
  1. `extensions.thread_ts`
  2. `extensions.reply_to`
  3. `MessageEnvelope.reply_to`
- Bus ordering/sharding key is `conversation_key = slack:<team_id>:<channel_id>`.
  Thread is not part of sharding, so different threads in the same channel share the same serialized worker.

### Status: Thread-Aware Context for `smart` Group Trigger

Implemented in V1:

- Runtime history scope is now thread-aware:
- when `thread_ts` is present, history context is isolated by thread;
- when `thread_ts` is empty, behavior remains channel-scoped.
- This applies to both addressing classification context and main task execution context.
- Bus `conversation_key` remains `slack:<team_id>:<channel_id>` in V1.

Remaining limitation:

- History is thread-scoped only for messages observed after runtime start; there is no first-hit thread backfill from Slack API yet.

- Implementation checklist is tracked in `docs/feat/feat_20260301_slack.md` ("Thread-Scoped History Plan (New)").

## 11. Heartbeat Delivery

`morph slack` can run heartbeat together with Slack runtime when:

- `cron.enabled: true`
- `heartbeat.enabled: true`
- `heartbeat.interval > 0`

Heartbeat notification messages are sent through Slack `chat.postMessage` to channels in `slack.allowed_channel_ids`.

- If `slack.allowed_channel_ids` is empty, heartbeat still runs, but notification delivery is skipped.
- If any target channel send fails, the notifier returns that error and awareness logs `awareness_notify_error`.

## 12. Group Trigger Implementation Note

Slack group-trigger addressing now shares the same prompt-rendering and LLM decision loop with Telegram via:

- `internal/grouptrigger/addressing_prompts.go`
- `internal/grouptrigger/decision.go`
