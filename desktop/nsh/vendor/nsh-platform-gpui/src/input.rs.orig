//! Pointer, wheel and keyboard input of a surface: hit testing over the
//! views, touches for the JS responder system, presses, hover / pressed
//! states, cursors, native pan / pinch / rotation values, routing wheel,
//! touchpad and touchscreen scrolling to the scroll views, and keys.
//!
//! The surface element ([`crate::events`]) turns GPUI's events into the
//! events here (root coordinates, points; times in seconds of the
//! surface's clock), and so does the test agent's input (`crate::synth`): real
//! and simulated input share every handler.
//!
//! Hit testing walks the views ([`pick`]), as the Linux backend does:
//! points go into children through their frames, the parent's scroll
//! offset and sticky shift ([`ViewState::child_origin`]) and their
//! transforms (inverted with [`Mat4::unproject`], so 3D transforms hit
//! where they are drawn). Hidden and concealed views, `pointerEvents`,
//! `hitSlop` and `overflow: hidden` are honored; outside a view's bounds,
//! only the area its descendants cover (`MountItem::Overflow`: a dropdown
//! under its field) is looked into, as on iOS and Android. The items a
//! view hosts ([`ViewState::natives`]: editors, headers, dialogs) are drawn
//! above its children and take the pointer first.
//!
//! Items, text fields and selectable text get the pointer events
//! themselves ([`Item`]): a press on them goes to them until it ends.
//! Presses, pans and scroll drags never start on hosted items and text
//! fields (they handle their own clicks, focus and selection drags), as
//! native widgets keep theirs on Linux; mouse drags over selectable text
//! select it rather than pan.
//!
//! Presses follow React Native and the other backends: the innermost view
//! listening to press events gets them (or the pressable text span under
//! the pointer; how it looks while pressed is the app's `activeStyle`,
//! applied by the core from the reported states); inside scroll views a touch reports `onPressDown` only after ~130 ms, as it may start a
//! scroll. A move beyond 6 pt starts the innermost pan or scroll view that
//! takes that direction (only touches and pens drag scroll views: the
//! mouse scrolls with the wheel, the touchpad, the keyboard and the
//! indicator, and its drags go to pans, responders and text selection);
//! beyond 10 pt the press is over.
//!
//! A view with a `panActivation` around the first pointer gates it
//! ([`Gate`], `PanActivation::decide` on every move): the scroll views
//! around the view wait until its pan fails, and never take the drag once
//! it activates; the activation goes to JS with the move's touches
//! (`TouchEvent::activated`), where the view becomes the responder.
//!
//! A scroll stays on the scroll view it began in (a touchpad gesture until
//! it ends, mouse wheel notches while they come within 200 ms), as in
//! browsers: inner views passing under the pointer do not take it over, and
//! its view reaching an edge does not hand the rest to an outer one.
//! Touchpad gestures end by GPUI's phases where the platform has them
//! (macOS, Windows' DirectManipulation; [`touchpad`]): fingers resting stop
//! a glide, lifting them glides on with the gesture's velocity (and the
//! system's momentum that follows is swallowed), as the macOS and Linux
//! backends do. Without phases (Wayland; X11 reports touchpads as wheel
//! lines) a precise scroll ends once its deltas pause. Touchpad pinches
//! (GPUI's `PinchEvent`, [`touchpad_pinch`]) and Ctrl + wheel pinch the
//! view under the pointer.
//!
//! The decisions over plain data (what a pointer going down may start, a
//! press's events, hover changes, hit areas, pinches, wheel latching) are
//! [`nsh_core::input`]'s, shared by the desktop backends.
