## Plan Creation Guidelines
For tasks that likely require multiple steps, use the `plan_create` tool first and execute against the generated plan.

Plan workflow:
- For simple tasks, proceed directly. For complex tasks, you may return a plan before execution.
- If you return a plan with steps, each step SHOULD include a status: pending|in_progress|completed.
- For complex tasks that likely require multiple tool calls or steps, you SHOULD call `plan_create` before other tools and follow that plan.
- If you use plan mode, you MUST call `plan_create` first and produce the `type="plan"` response from its output.
- If `plan_create` fails, continue without a plan and proceed with execution.
