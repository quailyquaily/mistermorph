# Built-in Tools

Mistermorph does not register every tool as one flat bundle. Tools are layered by runtime environment:

1. Static tools: created from config and directory context alone.
2. Engine tools: registered when an agent engine is assembled for a run.
3. Runtime tools: require an active LLM client/model or task context.
4. Dedicated tools: only appear inside concrete runtimes such as Telegram or Slack.

## Tool Groups at a Glance

| Group | When available | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Static tools | Available from config alone | `read_file`, `write_file`, `bash`, `powershell`, `url_fetch`, `web_search`, `contacts_send` |
| Engine tools | Available when an agent engine is assembled for a run | `spawn`, `coder` |
| Runtime tools | Available when the LLM or required context is available | `plan_create`, `todo_update`, `image_generate`, `image_edit` |
| Channel-specific tools | Available when the current channel is Telegram / Slack or another concrete channel runtime | `send_voice`, `send_photo`, `send_file`, `message_react` |

## Static Tools

For how `workspace_dir`, `file_cache_dir`, and `file_state_dir` fit together, see [Filesystem Roots](/guide/filesystem-roots).

Shell defaults are platform-specific:

- Linux/macOS: `bash` enabled by default, `powershell` disabled by default.
- Windows: `powershell` enabled by default, `bash` disabled by default.
- You can still override either one explicitly with `tools.<name>.enabled`.

### `read_file`

Reads local text files. The agent uses it to inspect config files, logs, cached results, `SKILL.md`, or state files.

- Key limits: subject to `tools.read_file.deny_paths`; supports `file_cache_dir/...` and `file_state_dir/...` aliases.

### `write_file`

Writes local files in overwrite or append mode, for generated output, state updates, or saving downloaded results locally.

- Key limits: writes are restricted to `file_cache_dir` / `file_state_dir`; relative paths default to `file_cache_dir`; size is capped by `tools.write_file.max_bytes`.

### `bash`

Executes local `bash` commands to call existing CLIs, run one-off conversions, execute scripts, or inspect the local environment.

- Key limits: restricted by `deny_paths` and internal deny-token rules; child processes inherit only an allowlisted environment.
- Current isolated-execution behavior: accepts `run_in_subtask=true` and runs the command inside one direct boundary; when the current runtime exposes a stream sink, stdout/stderr chunks can appear in the preview stream before the command exits.

### `powershell`

Executes local PowerShell commands. This is the Windows-oriented shell tool for calling existing CLIs, running scripts, and inspecting the local environment.

- Key limits: can be disabled via `tools.powershell.enabled`; restricted by `deny_paths` and internal deny-token rules; child processes inherit only an allowlisted environment.
- Current behavior: supports the same `file_cache_dir` / `file_state_dir` aliases as `bash`, including backslash path forms such as `file_cache_dir\foo.txt`.
- Current gap vs `bash`: does not currently expose `run_in_subtask=true`.

### `url_fetch`

Makes HTTP(S) requests and returns the response, or downloads the response into a local cache file. Supports `GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`, `download_path`, and `auth_profile`.

- Key limits: sensitive request headers are blocked; requests still pass through Guard network policy.
- Plain `GET` requests for allowlisted public post, shared-chat, article, and video URLs try Defuddle, then Jina Reader, then direct access. The allowlist covers X/Twitter posts and `t.co` short links, Reddit posts, public ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Grok shares, LinkedIn/Threads posts, YouTube/Bilibili videos, and Medium/Substack articles. Requests with custom headers, authentication, a body, or `download_path` remain direct.

### `web_search`

Runs a web search and returns structured search results. Useful for discovering leads, candidate pages, and public information entry points.

- Key limits: it returns search-result summaries, not full page bodies; result count is capped by `tools.web_search.max_results` and code-level limits.

### `contacts_send`

Sends one outbound message to a single contact. Delivery is chosen from the contact profile, such as Telegram, Slack, or LINE.

- Key limits: some group/supergroup contexts hide this tool by default.

## Engine Tools

These tools are registered when an agent engine is assembled for a run. They depend on the current engine state, so they are not part of the static base registry.

### `spawn`

Starts a subagent with its own context and an explicit tool whitelist. The parent agent waits synchronously until the inner run finishes, then receives a structured JSON envelope.

- Key limits: can be disabled via `tools.spawn.enabled`; the inner agent can use only the tool names passed in `tools`; raw transcript is not returned to the parent loop by default.
- Current observer hint: `spawn` accepts an optional `observe_profile` parameter. `default` keeps mid-run previews conservative, `long_shell` is suited to long shell/log output, and `web_extract` suppresses raw noisy output until better stage signals exist.

For parameter details, result envelope fields, test prompts, and the difference from `bash.run_in_subtask=true`, see [Subagents](/guide/subagents).

### `coder`

Runs a coding subtask with the local Codex or Claude Code CLI. The CLI stdout is read as streaming JSON/JSONL and text deltas are forwarded as tool-output events before the final `SubtaskResult` envelope is returned.

- Key limits: disabled by default via `tools.coder.enabled=false`, but `$coder` can expose it for one task; only supports `coder=codex` or `coder=claude`; runs local CLI processes with approval and permission prompts bypassed. If the CLIs are outside the service PATH, set `tools.coder.path_extra`.
- Default Codex path: `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --json -C <cwd> -`.
- Default Claude path: `claude -p <task> --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages --no-session-persistence --dangerously-skip-permissions --debug-file <log-dir>/debug.log`.

Both CLIs report startup, tool activity, and the remaining task time in Console progress. Codex reports command execution, file changes, MCP calls, and turn status; Claude reports initialization and tool activity. When Guard is enabled, progress shows status summaries with configured redaction; raw tool arguments, results, and stderr are withheld.

Each call saves `stdout.jsonl` and `stderr.log` in a separate `file_cache_dir/coder/codex-*` or `file_cache_dir/coder/claude-*` directory, or the system temporary directory when no cache directory is configured. Claude also writes `debug.log`. The progress output reports the directory. These raw logs can contain prompts and file contents; they remain local and are not automatically deleted. Timeout errors include elapsed time, the last activity, the stderr tail, and the log directory. The CLI shares the parent task deadline; `llm.request_timeout` does not control it.

Use this for Codex / Claude Code delegation.

## Runtime Tools

These tools are injected dynamically while the agent is running.

### `plan_create`

Generates structured execution-plan JSON, typically for complex task decomposition.

- Key limits: step count is capped by `tools.plan_create.max_steps`.

### `todo_update`

Maintains TODOs in `file_state_dir/cron.yaml`.

- Key limits: use `action=add_once` with `content` and `at` to add a one-time TODO; use `action=add_recurring` with `content` and a five-field numeric `cron` expression to add a recurring TODO. `title` is optional for new TODOs. Use `action=delete` to delete a TODO. Deletion prefers `id`; without `id`, it uses semantic matching on `content` and errors on no-match or ambiguous match.

For the runtime workflow around TODOs and `HEARTBEAT.md`, see [TODO and Heartbeat](/guide/todo-and-heartbeat).

### `image_generate`

Generates one image from a prompt and saves it under `file_cache_dir` or `workspace_dir`.

- Key limits: registered only when `tools.image_generate.enabled=true`, an image model is configured, and the current task has explicit image intent.
- Parameters: `prompt` is required. `output_path` is optional, supports `workspace_dir/...` and `file_cache_dir/...`, and relative paths resolve under `file_cache_dir/images/`.
- Output files are written as PNG or JPEG; the final extension is normalized to the returned MIME type.

### `image_edit`

Edits one local image from a prompt and saves the result under `file_cache_dir` or `workspace_dir`.

- Key limits: registered only when `tools.image_edit.enabled=true`, an image model is configured, and the current task has image-edit intent or retained image state.
- Parameters: `prompt` is required. Use `input_path`, or set `use_active_image=true` when the current session has an active image. `output_path` follows the same rules as `image_generate`.
- Input images must be readable from `workspace_dir` or `file_cache_dir`, must be PNG or JPEG, and must be at most 20 MB.

## Dedicated Tools

These tools do not exist in plain CLI or generic embedding scenarios. They are injected only when the corresponding channel runtime has enough context.

### `send_file`

Sends a local file from `file_cache_dir` to the current chat: a document in Telegram, an upload in Slack, a file message in Lark, an attachment in Discord and Mixin, and a file (or image or video) in WeChat and WhatsApp.

- Key limits: only local cached files are allowed; directories are invalid; each channel's file-size cap applies.

### `send_photo`

Sends a local image to the current Telegram, Lark or Mixin chat as an inline photo.

- Key limits: this is a photo-style send, not a document send; use `send_file` if the user should receive it as a file attachment.

### `send_voice`

Sends a local audio file to the current Telegram, Lark or Mixin chat as a voice message.

- Key limits: only local-file sending is supported; files are typically expected under `file_cache_dir`; Lark expects OPUS audio; this tool does not do text-to-speech.

### `message_react`

Adds a lightweight emoji reaction to the current message, for cases like acknowledgement, approval, or a quick "seen" signal that does not justify a full text reply.

- Telegram variant: reacts to a Telegram message with an emoji and can optionally use large-reaction style.
- Slack variant: reacts to a Slack message using a Slack emoji name, not a raw Unicode emoji.
- Key limits: parameter shape differs by channel; without channel-specific message context, the tool may be absent or require explicit target parameters.

## Tool Selection in Core Embedding

You can whitelist built-ins via `integration.Config.BuiltinToolNames`.

```go
cfg.BuiltinToolNames = []string{"read_file", "url_fetch", "todo_update"}
```

Empty list means all known built-ins.

## Key Config Sections

```yaml
tools:
  read_file: ...
  write_file: ...
  spawn: ...
  coder: ...
  bash: ...
  powershell: ...
  url_fetch: ...
  web_search: ...
  contacts_send: ...
  todo_update: ...
  plan_create: ...
```

Console Setup / Settings and the `/api/settings/agent` payload use the same nested shape, for example `tools.spawn.enabled` and `tools.coder.enabled`.

For the full configuration, see [Config Reference](/guide/config-reference.md).
