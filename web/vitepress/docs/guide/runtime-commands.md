# Commands

Commands are messages that start with `/` inside interactive chat, Console tasks, or channel runtimes.

> In Slack, `/` triggers Slack's own command system, so add a leading space before `/`, for example ` /models`.
>
> In Slack group chats, commands must explicitly address the bot. In Telegram group chats, normal bot commands such as `/models@BotName` are supported.
>
> In Mixin groups, prefix the command with the bot's Mixin ID mention, for example `@7000123456 /models`.
>
> On Discord, the commands are also registered as slash commands. A typed command in a server must mention the bot, for example `@Morph /models`.

## Common Commands

These commands are available in CLI chat, Console Web, Telegram, Slack, LINE, Lark, Mixin Messenger, Discord, WeChat, and WhatsApp.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Lists currently available commands. |
| `/stop` | Stops the current running task in this conversation. |
| `/models` | Shows the current model. |
| `/think <task>` | Runs the task through the `think` LLM route. |
| `/skills` | Shows current skills. |
| `/ctx` | Shows context-window usage for the current conversation. |
| `/ctx compact` | Compacts older conversation context into a checkpoint now. |
| `/workspace` | Shows the current workspace directory. |

`/stop` only targets the active task in the same runtime and conversation, topic, or thread. If no task is running, Mister Morph replies `🤔`. If the stop request is accepted, it replies `👌`.

While a task is running, a normal non-command message is treated as steer input for that same task instead of creating a new task. Accepted steer input replies `👌`. If the task exists but can no longer accept steer input, it replies `😵‍💫`.

`/ctx` does not call the LLM. If no agent turn has recorded usage yet, it says no context usage has been recorded.

`/ctx compact` makes one checkpoint LLM request without checking the automatic compaction threshold. It does not enter the normal agent loop, and neither the command nor its confirmation is added to conversation history. It returns an error when context compaction is disabled or there is no safe history prefix to compact.

For `/workspace`, these forms are supported:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/workspace` | Shows the current workspace directory. |
| `/workspace attach <dir>` | Attaches or replaces the workspace directory. |
| `/workspace detach` | Detaches the current workspace. |

For `/models`, these forms are supported:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/models` | Shows the current model. |
| `/models list` | Lists configured model profiles. |
| `/models set <profile_name>` | Switches the current model. |
| `/models reset` | Resets model selection to automatic mode. |

For `/think`, put the task text after the command:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/think <task>` | Strips the command prefix, resolves `llm.routes.think`, and temporarily applies `reasoning_effort=xhigh` for that task. |
