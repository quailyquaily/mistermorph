# Subagents

## Common Scenarios

Use a subagent boundary mainly in these cases:

- A shell command is slow or noisy, and you want its output isolated from the parent loop.
- The work is still multi-step, but you want the inner execution to operate with a narrower tool set.
- You want one compact final result instead of leaking raw intermediate output back to the parent.
- The child work should run in the local Codex or Claude Code CLI.

Choose the entry like this:

- Use `bash.run_in_subtask=true` for one concrete shell command.
- Use `spawn` when the inner execution still needs agent-style tool use such as `read_file`, `url_fetch`, or `bash`.
- Use `coder` when the inner execution should be delegated to local Codex or Claude Code.
- Do not add an isolated layer for trivial one-step work the parent can finish directly.

## Overview

Mistermorph currently exposes three isolated-task entries:

| Entry | Starts another LLM loop | Best for | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spawn` | Yes | an inner agent that still needs tools and reasoning | `SubtaskResult` JSON envelope |
| `coder` | No local inner Mister Morph loop; starts Codex or Claude Code CLI | coding subtasks handled by local coding-agent CLIs | `SubtaskResult` JSON envelope |
| `bash.run_in_subtask=true` | No | one shell command with isolated execution/output | `SubtaskResult` JSON envelope |

Shared behavior:

- All three are synchronous. The parent waits until the inner run finishes.
- All three share the same depth limit.
- All three return the same top-level envelope shape.
- These paths do not send the raw inner transcript back into the parent loop by default.

This feature is about isolation and result collection. It is not a background job system yet.

## Current Implementation

### `spawn`

`spawn` is an engine-scoped tool. It appears only after an agent engine is assembled for a run.

Parameters:

- `task`: required prompt for the inner agent.
- `tools`: required non-empty tool-name array.
- `model`: optional model override for the inner agent.
- `output_schema`: optional structured-output label.
- `observe_profile`: optional observer hint. Supported values are `default`, `long_shell`, and `web_extract`.

Current behavior:

- The inner registry is built from the tool names passed in `tools`.
- Unknown or unavailable tool names are ignored.
- If no usable tool remains, the call fails.
- `spawn` is never re-exposed inside the inner agent, even if listed in `tools`.

### `coder`

`coder` is also an engine-scoped tool.

Parameters:

- `coder`: required backend, `codex` or `claude`
- `task`: required prompt for the coding CLI
- `cwd`: optional working-directory override

Current behavior:

- `codex` runs `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --json -C <cwd> -` and sends the task through stdin
- `claude` runs `claude -p <task> --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages --no-session-persistence --dangerously-skip-permissions`
- stdout is parsed as streaming JSON/JSONL and text deltas are emitted as tool-output events
- the final result is normalized into the same `SubtaskResult` envelope used by `spawn`
- `coder` is never re-exposed inside isolated child runs

### `bash.run_in_subtask=true`

This is the lighter isolated-execution path.

- It uses the direct isolated path behind `bash`.
- It does not start a second LLM loop.
- Its `output_schema` is fixed to `subtask.bash.result.v1`.
- Its observer profile is fixed to `long_shell`.

Use it when the inner work is already one concrete shell step and does not need more tool decisions.

### Depth Limit

The current depth limit is `1`.

- A root run can enter one isolated extra layer.
- A run that is already inside that layer cannot enter another one.

### `output_schema`

`output_schema` is only a contract label. It is not a built-in JSON Schema registry.

If you set it for `spawn`:

- the inner agent is told to produce JSON final output;
- the runtime requires the final output to be JSON or JSON-parsable text;
- the same identifier is echoed back in the result envelope.

Mistermorph does not validate the returned object against a real schema definition.

### Result Envelope

All three entries return JSON in this shape:

```json
{
  "task_id": "sub_123",
  "status": "done",
  "summary": "subtask completed",
  "output_kind": "text",
  "output_schema": "",
  "output": "child result",
  "error": ""
}
```

Meaning of the fields:

- `status`: currently `done` or `failed`.
- `summary`: short status text for the isolated run.
- `output_kind`: `text` or `json`.
- `output_schema`: empty for plain text output, or the identifier you passed in.
- `output`: the result payload.
- `error`: set only when the run fails.

For `bash.run_in_subtask=true`, `output` is structured JSON with `exit_code`, truncation flags, `stdout`, and `stderr`.

### Test Prompts

These are good smoke tests when `spawn` and `bash` are enabled.

#### Prompt 1: `spawn` + `bash`, return one line

```text
You must call the spawn tool. Do not answer directly. Allow the inner agent to use only bash. Have it run `printf 'alpha\nbeta\ngamma\n' | sed -n '2p'`. Return only the second line.
```

Expected result: `beta`

#### Prompt 2: `spawn` + `bash`, return structured JSON

```text
You must call the spawn tool and set output_schema to `subagent.demo.echo.v1`. Allow the inner agent to use only bash. Have it run `echo '{"ok":true,"value":42}'`. Return structured JSON only, with no explanation.
```

Expected result:

```json
{"ok":true,"value":42}
```

#### Prompt 3: `bash.run_in_subtask=true`

```text
Call the bash tool and set `run_in_subtask` to true. Run `printf 'one\ntwo\nthree\n' | tail -n 1`. Do not explain anything. Return only the last line.
```

Expected result: `three`

#### Prompt 4: longer isolated shell run

```text
Call the bash tool and set `run_in_subtask` to true. Run `sleep 1; echo SUBAGENT_BASH_OK`. Reply with stdout only.
```

Expected result: `SUBAGENT_BASH_OK`

### Config and Embedding

- `tools.spawn.enabled` controls only the explicit `spawn` tool entry.
- `tools.coder.enabled` controls whether the explicit `coder` tool entry is exposed by default. It defaults to false because the child Codex / Claude Code process runs with approval and permission prompts bypassed. `$coder` can still expose it for one task.
- `tools.coder.path_extra` prepends directories to PATH only when `coder` launches `codex` or `claude`.
- Direct isolated runs such as `bash.run_in_subtask=true` still work even if `tools.spawn.enabled=false`.
- `integration.Config.BuiltinToolNames` can include or omit `spawn` and `coder`.
- If you build an engine directly with `agent.New(...)`, `spawn` is enabled by default, while `coder` is disabled by default. Override them with `agent.WithSpawnToolEnabled(...)` and `agent.WithCoderToolEnabled(...)`.

Example:

```go
cfg := integration.DefaultConfig()
cfg.BuiltinToolNames = []string{"read_file", "url_fetch", "spawn", "coder"}
cfg.Set("tools.spawn.enabled", true)
cfg.Set("tools.coder.enabled", true)
```
