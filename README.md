# Mister Morph

Desktop app, CLI, and reusable Go runtime for AI agents.

Other languages: [简体中文](docs/zh-CN/README.md) | [日本語](docs/ja-JP/README.md)

To try Mister Morph, start with the desktop App from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/quailyquaily/mistermorph/releases). It includes the Console UI, starts the local backend, and guides first-run setup.

## Why Mister Morph

- 🖥️ App-first setup: use the desktop App to get started; use the CLI when you need a server or script.
- 🧩 Reusable Go core: run Mister Morph as an App, CLI, or Console backend, or embed it in your projects.
- 🤝 Connection: [Aqua](https://mistermorph.com/aqua) lets agents talk to each other, so multiple agents can plan and work together.
- 🛠️ Practical extensions: built-in tools, `SKILL.md` skills, and Go embedding cover local use and automation.
- 🔒 Security-minded: auth profiles, outbound policy, approvals, and redaction are built in.

## Quick Start

### Desktop App (recommended)

1. Download a release asset from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/quailyquaily/mistermorph/releases) page:
   - macOS: `MrMorph-darwin-arm64.dmg`
   - Linux: `MrMorph-linux-amd64.AppImage` or `MrMorph-linux-amd64.deb`
   - Windows: `MrMorph-windows-amd64.zip`
2. Open the App.
3. Use the Agent.

Build, packaging, and platform notes: [docs/app.md](docs/app.md)

### CLI

Install the CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/install-mistermorph.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quailyquaily/mistermorph/refs/heads/master/scripts/install-release.sh
sudo bash /tmp/install-mistermorph.sh
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quailyquaily/mistermorph.git
cd mistermorph
go build -o "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/morph" ./cmd/mistermorph
```

Set up a workspace, set an API key, and run one task:

```bash
morph install
export MISTER_MORPH_LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
morph run "Hello!"
```

If `config.yaml` is missing, `morph install` starts the setup wizard and writes the first workspace files.

Run `morph` to start a terminal chat, equivalent to `morph chat`. The agent runs locally and shares topics and history with Web Console through the same state directory. Chat does not start Console or require a runtime token. It opens a new conversation directly; the first message creates the shared topic. Use `/topics` to open existing topics and `morph console` when you want the Web UI. Local flags such as `morph --model MODEL` work directly. See [terminal chat](docs/chat.md) for details, or `morph --help` for commands and flags.

Use `morph console` to start the Web Console. The older `morph console serve` and `morph run --task "Hello!"` forms remain supported. For `run`, use either positional task text or `--task`, not both. Quote task text to preserve whitespace; use `--` before task text that starts with a dash.

## Development

Useful commands:

```bash
./scripts/build-backend.sh --output ./bin/morph
./scripts/build-desktop.sh --release
go test ./...
```

The Console frontend lives in `web/console/` and uses `pnpm`. See [docs/console.md](docs/console.md) and [docs/app.md](docs/app.md) for build details.

## Configuration Template

The canonical config template is [assets/config/config.example.yaml](assets/config/config.example.yaml).
Environment variables use the `MISTER_MORPH_` prefix. Full config notes and common flags are in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Storage Compatibility

Mister Morph uses the unified domain journal as the source of truth for task/topic facts.

Legacy Console topic/task files are still read as a one-time migration path when the new projection snapshot is missing. This keeps existing workspaces usable during the transition. The migration code is planned for removal in version `0.3`.
