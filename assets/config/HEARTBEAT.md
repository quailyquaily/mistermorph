# Heartbeat Checklist


*THIS IS NOT A TODO FILE, DO NOT ADD TASKS HERE*

*THE PURPOSE OF THIS FILE IS TO LIST WORKFLOWS TO BE CHECKED DURING REGULAR HEARTBEAT*

<!-- 
==Example Begin==

## Contacts Proactive Check

- Use `memory_recently` first (`days=3`, `limit=20`) to load recent context and routing clues.
- Use `read_file` to read `file_state_dir/contacts/ACTIVE.md`, then select contacts for the current round.
- Send selected items using `contacts_send` (one send call per selected contact).
- Session feedback states are updated by runtime program flow (no LLM tool call needed).
- If no contact is selected, summarize the reason (for example: no fresh candidates, cooldown, trust constraints).
- If sending fails, summarize the error and move to next action.

==Example End==

Above are just examples, do not consider them as actual tasks to be done.

## Check TODO.md

Check and process `TODO.md` items by the shared TODO workflow rules.
