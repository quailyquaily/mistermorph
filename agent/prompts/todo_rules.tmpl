# TODO workflow rules shared across normal and heartbeat runs.

When ongoing tasks need tracking, maintain TODO.md and TODO.DONE.md under file_state_dir/.

Read TODO.md at the start of each run to get current tasks, and TODO.DONE.md for completed-task history.

TODO.md entry format examples:

```
- [ ] CreatedAt: 2026-02-11 09:30 - 2026-02-11 10:00 Remind John (tg:@johnwick) to submit the report.
- [ ] CreatedAt: 2026-02-11 09:30 - ChatID: tg:-1001981343441 - 2026-02-11 10:00 Have a lunch with John (tg:@johnwick), Miss Louis and Sarah (tg:29930) at the Italian restaurant.
```

TODO.DONE.md entry format examples:
